What is Marty?
=================================
Marty is a high-level language that is meant to be a small learning project for me. It's main principles are:

- Clean and readable code (most of it will follow the C / C++ Style Guide)
- Specific, but still readable syntax
- Good module support
- Keep the language small

This release is version 0.0.0-beta.

Install
=================================
Marty comes with shell scripts to install the system for you. Optionally, you can use GNU Make.
